						<b>Description</b><br>
						<u>Hipster:</u> A person considered by themselves (and others) to be at the forefront of what's "hip". They may be either male, female, or other. The hip forefront generally includes fashion, and it may also include food & drink, music, art, and travel destinations. One's neighborhood is also very important, as the hipster considers there to be a clear line between fashionable and unfashionable neighborhoods.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Needs</b> (of the User from the Site)<br>
						The hipster needs the most up-to-date information to pick the most hip event to attend. Enough detail needs to be included to judge the hipness, so posters of events should be able to enter an adequate description and location, as well as the date & time information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Frustrations</b><br>
						The hipsters number one frustration is not having enough information to judge the hipness of an event. When in doubt, though, the hipster will rule out all events that do not include enough details for the judge the hipness of the event.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ideal Features</b><br>
						Prompts for event poseters to input detailed information, such as:
						<ul>
							<li>Date & Time</li>
							<li>Location (Address or GPS)</li>
							<li></li>
							<li></li>
							<li></li>
							<li></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Information Desired</b><br>
						Any information the persona needs when trying to do their goal. These help designers understand the key information needed to communicate to users.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Behaviors</b><br>
						These are the typical behaviours the persona exhibits. They're usually only shown if the personas different behaviors lead to different requirements for the system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Scenarios</b><br>
						These are sample use cases the persona may do. They can be based on either their goals or their use of an existing system. This can clarify exactly how a system will be used.
					</li>
