						<b>Description</b><br>
						<u>Hipster:</u> A person considered by themselves (and others) to be at the forefront of what's "hip". They may be either male, female, or other. The hip forefront generally includes fashion, and it may also include food & drink, music, art, and travel destinations. One's neighborhood is also very important, as the hipster considers there to be a clear line between fashionable and unfashionable neighborhoods.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Needs</b> (of the User from the Site)<br>
						The hipster needs the most up-to-date information to pick the most hip event to attend. Enough detail needs to be included
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Frustrations</b><br>
						These are issues that the persona encounters, either with the existing system or because there's no existing system. These can clarify to designers exactly what the biggest issues this persona faces, and how the site can help them overcome their frustrations.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ideal Features</b><br>
						This is very similar to features, but with no restrictions placed on their feasibility... These may be impossible to produce, but sometimes help designers think of alternative approaches that are more realistic.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Information Desired</b><br>
						Any information the persona needs when trying to do their goal. These help designers understand the key information needed to communicate to users.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Behaviors</b><br>
						These are the typical behaviours the persona exhibits. They're usually only shown if the personas different behaviors lead to different requirements for the system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Scenarios</b><br>
						These are sample use cases the persona may do. They can be based on either their goals or their use of an existing system. This can clarify exactly how a system will be used.
					</li>

				<h2>Use Case</h2>
