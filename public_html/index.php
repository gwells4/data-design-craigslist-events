				<h2>Persona</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Quote</b><br>
						A 'quote' from the persona could oversimplify the persona, but it has the added advantage of giving the personas further personality.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Description</b><br>
						A description gives a brief summary of the persona, which often contains demographic information (sometimes going into surprisingly large amounts of detail). The description might include (among other information) their job, their technology, any pressures they're under and the situation they're in when they use the system/site.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Needs</b> (of the User from the Site)<br>
						Needs, goals & features can either be a straight list for each persona, or a table comparing each persona against each possible need/feature/goal. This can help define a priority list for features (or the needs from which to develop features) before development starts.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Frustrations</b><br>
						These are issues that the persona encounters, either with the existing system or because there's no existing system. These can clarify to designers exactly what the biggest issues this persona faces, and how the site can help them overcome their frustrations.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ideal Features</b><br>
						This is very similar to features, but with no restrictions placed on their feasibility... These may be impossible to produce, but sometimes help designers think of alternative approaches that are more realistic.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Information Desired</b><br>
						Any information the persona needs when trying to do their goal. These help designers understand the key information needed to communicate to users.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Behaviors</b><br>
						These are the typical behaviours the persona exhibits. They're usually only shown if the personas different behaviors lead to different requirements for the system.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Scenarios</b><br>
						These are sample use cases the persona may do. They can be based on either their goals or their use of an existing system. This can clarify exactly how a system will be used.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<!-- Section 2: Use Case -->
			<section>
				<h2>Use Case</h2>
				<p>How, when, and where does a persona interact with your product? What are your users or personaâ€™s goals? What steps must they take to complete their goal? This process can be mapped out in a flow chart or diagram.</p>

						<b>Search Box</b><br>
						A 'quote' from the persona could oversimplify the persona, but it has the added advantage of giving the personas further personality.

					<li>
						<b>List of Events</b><br>
						A description gives a brief summary of the persona, which often contains demographic information (sometimes going into surprisingly large amounts of detail). The description might include (among other information) their job, their technology, any pressures they're under and the situation they're in when they use the system/site.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Calendar</b> (of the User from the Site)<br>
						Needs, goals & features can either be a straight list for each persona, or a table comparing each persona against each possible need/feature/goal. This can help define a priority list for features (or the needs from which to develop features) before development starts.
